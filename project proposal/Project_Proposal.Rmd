# Project Title: COVID-19 Prediction using Explainable Machine Learning


## Background and Motivation:
The COVID-19 or the SARS-CoV-2 originated from the district of Wuhan, China has transpired to be a pandemic worldwide [@WHO]. Research on the COVID-19 is a hot topic among the Artificial Intelligence community recently. Due to shortage and limited efficiency of current testing mechanism of COVID-19 tests, i.e. through RT-PCR kits [@Zhao2020COVIDCTDatasetAC] which usually takes upto 4-6 hours to reproduce the results which is not very optimal way to move forward as the rate of COVID-19 patients registered grows exponentially. With this problem in scientific community, it motivated to aim of Data Science Methodology be brought to be a part in helping flattening the curve. So, this lead to a possibility of building classifiers which can diagonise patients as COVID-19 negative or positive based on their respective X-Ray images [citation of some similar experiments]. As this approach is can be less time and resource consuming and hoped to achieve more streamlined performance compared to RT-PCR kits. Also in addition to a good prediction, we needed reasons that could justify what could be the features that are responsible in the diagonistic process [@karim2020deepcovidexplainer]. 

With this idea and motivation in hand, our work tries to experiment in building classifier with CXR (Chest X-Rays) as Ground Truth predicts whether an X-Ray image belongs to COVID-19 negative or positive. Along with, we try to come up with features that contributes to the detection of an image and also with an explaination delineating why was such a behaviour observed.

## Project Objective:

With the motivation to help fight against and analyse COVID-19, we came up with a research question of whether

> Can we use a Data-Science methods to diagonise and explain COVID-19 ? 

To answer the this question, we aim to answer few sub-questions:

* How well could classifiers perform on Chest X-Rays?
* Although [@Zhao2020COVIDCTDatasetAC] and [@karim2020deepcovidexplainer] extensively works with Neural Networks (Black-Box Model) to classify, Can simple and intrinsically explainable classifiers achieve a base Accuracy, F~1~-Score and AUC of 85% using CXR?
* How does different features of CXR contribute to the model prediction and Can we come up with few number of feature w.r.t their importance?
* Which flavour of algorithm perform best among all and is there a possibility of Classification in Ensemble setting?
* Can we come up with explaination of our model's decsision and prediction?

## Ground Truth and Technology Stack:

### Technology Stack
The project will be built in `R` with usage of API’s like `magick`, `opencv` for image processing and `tidyverse` packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for data visualization, `rmarkdown` and `knitr` for reproducible and automated reporting, `shiny` for interactive web applications and `tidymodels` for inferential and predictive modeling.

### Dataset
Our Dataset consists of 313 Positive COVID CXR and 1000 Negative CXR collected from four different sources to make our version of the dataset to work upon. This includes COVIDx dataset of @karim2020deepcovidexplainer[^1], Kaggle CXR Pneumonia dataset by Paul Mooney [^2], CXR images of adult subjects from the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge [^3], original and augmented versions of COVID-19 examples [^4] from @cohen2020covid. 

According to [@Zhao2020COVIDCTDatasetAC; @wang2020deep; @li2020artificial; @karim2020deepcovidexplainer] CT-Scan data would be gold-standard for us and also potray pretty good results evaluated in terms of Accuracy and F~1~-Score. However, due to CT Scan being available in very less quantity publicly, we would like to use Chest X-rays as our dataset. Though, it won't be that competible in terms of quality w.r.t CT-Scans but @KERMANY20181122 suggests CXR to be sufficient and comparable to CT-Scans in order to diagnose COVID-19 patients.

In particular we will use the [COVID-19 Dataset Repository](https://shorturl.at/qwLR0) as our Ground Truth.

## Design overview (Algorithms and Methods):
We would be following a typical Data Science pipeline starting with Pre-Processing of the Dataset, Feature Extraction and Selection and then feeding Descriptors (Trainable Vectors) to different classifiers to train and test and then finally evaluation would be done based on predictor's results. The details are delineated in the following sections:

* **Pre-Processing**
  - There exist several texture-based vision algorithms. We will try to combine features before training and train our model on a combined feature set; Or else we can train models on individual features, and then combine prediction results might be combined and thus one feature might only not be selected but multiple features can be selected [@pereira2020covid]. 
  - Literature survey tells us Local Binary Patterns [@nanni2010local] shall be a good choice for texture-based descriptor. 
  - We will also try to use pretrained networks to gain texture descriptors or vision API’s for the extraction part. Moreover, there are several Neural-Nets we faced in literature survey, that are carefully curated for the purpose of the COVID-19, which requires the image to directly fed to the net, and thereby auto-encodes the parameters [@pereira2020covid].

* **Classification**
  - The problem in hand is a classification problem where we would be classifying an image being COVID-19 positive or negative along with a class imbalance problem [@fernandez2013analysing]. 
  - Here, we would like to emphasize that the model won’t predict presence or absence or pneumonia, which is a result not only of COVID-19 but other kind of reasons also affect this.
  - We intend to work on following algorithms:
    + Clustering Algorithms
      - k-Means
      - kNN
    + Support Vector Machines 
    + Binary Classifiers
      - Decision Trees
      - Naive Bayes
  - Mostly because the models are intrinsically explainable.

  - The above figure suggests the overall overview of an architecture of the system we would like to develop.

* **Evaluation**
  - The higher the metric value the better the performance.
  - *Accuracy:* Best and mostly used metric. Easily suited for binary as well as multiclass classification problem.
  - *Precision:* It is a best choice when we want to be very sure of our prediction.
  - *Recall:* Captures as many positives as possible
  - *F~1~-Score:* It is a harmonic mean between Precision and Recall.
  - *AUC & ROC:* Indicates how well the probabilities from the positive classes are separated from the negative classes. ROC is the probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability.
