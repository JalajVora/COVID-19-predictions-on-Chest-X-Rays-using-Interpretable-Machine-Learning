# Explanable Machine Learning for COVID-19 Prediction on Chest X-Rays

From the last meet on 03.09.2020, we were given time till 24.09.2020 to work upon the Feature Engineering part. After our experiment and literature survey, We all agreed to stick to Uli's suggested timeline, i.e. to end the project by 24.03.2021.

Our problem after last attempt was to work specifically on CheXNet architecture as we intend to use it as our feature extractor. For a recap, we intend to stick to 14 radiological features [@durrani2020chest; @cozzi2020chest; @cleverley2020role; @rubin2020role], detected by CheXNet and also suggested by other papers to detect COVID-19 in CXRs.

These features are:
1. Atelectasis
2. Cardiomegaly
3. Consolidation 
4. Edema
5. Effusion 
6. Emphysema 
7. Fibrosis
8. Hernia 
9. Infiltration
10. Mass
11. Nodule
12. Pleural Thickening
13. Pneumonia
14. Pneumothorax

On a deep dive to the architecture we came to know it's know how and also we tried to configure in a way that it detects the presence of features as probabilities. Also, we faced an issue that the architecture is made in such a manner that it inputs the radiologically annotated NIH dataset in order to train and test. Whereas, we intend to use this architecture as pre-trained network which works on our COVID-19 dataset.

After several attempts, we're still working on the modifying the architecture so that it also works for non-annotated dataset similar to ours. With this attempt, on our minor literature survey, we found that there are few attempts by [@barstugan2020coronavirus; @apostolopoulos2020extracting; @hasan2020classification; @elaziz2020new; @perumal2020detection; @khuzani2020covid] which work for a similar objective but in different fashion i.e., using mixture of texture based and other methods. Also, we found that we intend to experiment with MobileNetv2 architecture in order to check whether this modification could work for our objective or not!


## Inferences of feedback on 24.09.2020:

We found our presentation went good according to our supervisors but they had few comments on the progress. We inferred that:
