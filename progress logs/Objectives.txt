Project Objectives:

1. Global Interpretability [Subhankar]
	1.1 Feature Importance (Permutation)
	1.2 PDP
	1.3 Measuring interaction
	1.4 Surrogate Model [LASSO, Ridge and Logistic Regression]


2. Local Interpretability [Shivam]
	2.1 SHAP - so far we have shap values from all 5 models
	2.2 Individual SHAP value plot
	2.3 5 Models :: SHAP values :: Consolidation


3. Global :: We have Surrogate model experiment. Variance between Neural Network and Linear Models (LASSO, RIDGE and Logistic Regression) [Jalaj]
	3.1 r-squared = 1 - (variance of prediction differences / variance of black box model predictions)
	3.2 Correlation Analysis


4. We need to find out what relation could be established between local and global interpretability [Subhajit]
	4.1 Cluserting SHAP values
	4.2 Interaction between global and local SHAP


5. SHAP values plots, Inference plots and EDA in Final Report [Jalaj]
