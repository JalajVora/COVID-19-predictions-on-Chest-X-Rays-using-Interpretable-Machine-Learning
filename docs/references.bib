  abstract = {Summary
The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

abstract = "Texture is an important characteristic for many types of images. In recent years, very discriminative and computationally efficient local texture descriptors based on local binary patterns (LBPs) have been developed, which has led to significant progress in applying texture methods to different problems and applications. Due to this progress, the division between texture descriptors and more generic image or video descriptors has been disappearing. A large number of different variants of LBP have been developed to improve its robustness and to increase its discriminative power and applicability to different types of problems. In this chapter, the most recent and important variants of LBP in 2-D, spatiotemporal, 3-D, and 4-D domains are surveyed. Interesting new developments of LBP in 1-D signal analysis are also considered. Finally, some future challenges for research are presented."
